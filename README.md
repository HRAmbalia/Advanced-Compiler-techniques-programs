# Compiler Design Programs

This repository contains various programs related to compiler design. Below is a list of the programs included:

## Algorithms List 

1. **Convert Suffix Code to 3-Address Code**
   - This program converts a given suffix expression (postfix notation) to its equivalent 3-address code.

2. **Find Predecessors & Successors & Dominators**
   - This program identifies the predecessors, successors, and dominators for each node in a control flow graph.

3. **Check Validity of String Using Finite Automata**
   - This program uses finite automata to check whether a given string is valid or invalid based on a specified set of rules.

4. **Extract Natural Loops from Control Flow Graph**
   - This program extracts natural loops present in a given control flow graph.

5. **Calculate Reach_In and Reach_Out Sets**
   - This program calculates the Reach_In and Reach_Out sets using predecessor, generate, and kill sets.

6. **Find Dominance Frontier and Post-Dominator Tree**
   - This program determines the dominance frontier and constructs the post-dominator tree for a control flow graph.

7. **Perform Local Copy Propagation**
   - This program performs local copy propagation to optimize the intermediate code by replacing redundant copies of variables.

8. **Perform Live Variable Analysis**
   - This program performs live variable analysis to determine the variables that are live at each point in the program.

9. **Create and Test Finite Automata**
   - This program creates a finite automaton and tests its functionality with different input strings.

10. **Find Basic Blocks from 3-Address Code**
    - This program identifies and extracts basic blocks from a given set of 3-address code instructions.
